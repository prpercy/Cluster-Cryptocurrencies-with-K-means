# Module 10
Cluster cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods.

 
---

> This program is used to perform clustering analysis of cryptocurrencies.
---
The goal of the program is to achieve following:
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
* Perform a principal component analysis (PCA) and reduce the features to three principal components
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

## Technologies

> Program uses Python 3.10.6 version and Jupyter Lab

* Program uses 'Pandas' library to work with dataframes. 
* Program uses 'hvplot.pandas' libraries for visualization 
* Most importantly 'scikit-learn' library is used. From scikit-learn we import KMeans to perform cluster analysis, StandardScaler to scale numerical data columns and PCA for principal component analysis
